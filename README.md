## Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree

Keeping a working folder for projects of [Udacity's Data Scientist Nano Degree program](https://de.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). So far completed:

1. Supervised Learning Project
    Predicting donors for fictitious CharityML organization. Includes a short section for feature exploration. Fits Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine from Scikit-learn as potential solutions. Final model is chosen based on its f-score and optimized through GridSearch before making predictions.
2. Deep Learning Project
    Uses transfer learning through Pytorch to train model and predict names of 102 different flowers. Inputs are image files.
