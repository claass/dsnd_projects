## Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree

Keeping a working folder for projects of [Udacity's Data Scientist Nano Degree program](https://de.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). So far completed:

1. **Supervised Learning Project** - Predicting donors for fictitious CharityML organization. Includes a short section for feature exploration. Fits Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine as model candidates. Final model is chosen based on its f-score and optimized through GridSearch before making predictions.
2. **Deep Learning Project** - Uses transfer learning to retrain a model and predict the names of 102 different flowers based on image inputs. Includes a command line interface to classify new images as provided by the user.
3. **Unsupervised Learning projects** - The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. Applies unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.
