## Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree

Keeping a working folder for projects of [Udacity's Data Scientist Nano Degree program](https://de.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). So far completed:

1. **Supervised Learning Project** - Predicting donors for fictitious CharityML organization. Includes a short section for feature exploration. Fits Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine as model candidates. Final model is chosen based on its f-score and optimized through GridSearch before making predictions.

2. **Deep Learning Project** - Uses transfer learning to retrain a model and predict the names of 102 different flowers based on image inputs. Includes a command line interface to classify new images as provided by the user.

3. **Unsupervised Learning projects** - The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. Applies unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.

3. **Disaster Response Pipeline Project** - This project is a web app to aid disaster relief workers by assigning text messages up to 36 different labels related to its content. The web app also displays visualizations of the training data used to train the algorithm. Under the hood the web app is using a random forest algorithm with varying performance by label. Also included are a script to load, clean, and save the input data provided by FigureEight and another script to retrain the classifier.
