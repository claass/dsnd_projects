# Unsupervised Learning Project

### About this project:
In this notebook unsupervised learning techniques are used on demographic and spending data to create distinct customer segments. The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. The project is divided in three steps:

	 1. Preprocessing the data including feature generation and missing value handling
	 2. Applying dimensionality reduction techniques for better performance
	 3. Implementing clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.


### How to get started:

1. The `Identify_Customer_Segments.html` explains the process plus contains static images to help illustrate.

2. The `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb` can be downloaded to dig into the implementation. However, acces to the the data underlying this project is restricted and needs to be requested from Arvato or Udacity.
